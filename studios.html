              Each tutorial will be used as a critique session (i.e., studio), where every group hast to present their weekly progress to the rest of the class. Each group has <b>7 minutes</b> to present the deliverables listed for the studios listed below. <b>Each group must explicitly include a group name in their presentation to help students and instructors organize the critiques</b>. <br/><br/>
	      After each presentation is a 10-12 minute discussion period, during which time students from other groups are expected to critique the presented work. Everyone is expected to participate in the studio sessions; <b>your engagement in each studio class will be graded based on your active participation to class</b>, e.g. by asking questions, answering questions, making comments after presentations, etc... <br /><br/>
	      Additionally, <b>every student must submit write-ups of their critiques of the other groups that presented in their class</b> on Markus by 12:00pm (noon) sharp on the Friday after each studio. Please submit one PDF file per group (one for each group in your studio section except your own group), named with that group's name (e.g. "TheOtherGoup.pdf"). Do not include your name or any identifying information on these documents.
