	  <h4> Engagement in class</h4>
	  You are expected to attend and actively participate to lectures and tutorials. Your engagement in class is worth 10% of your final grade. Your engagement grade in each class will be calculated based on your <b>attendance</b> (absent: 0, present for only part of the class: 1, present for the whole class: 2), and <b>active participation</b> (none: 0, fair: 1, good: 2) to class, e.g. by asking questions, answering to questions, making comments on presentations, etc... 
	  
	  <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> Individual in-class assignments</h4>
	  There will be graded in-class individual activities at every single lecture and tutorial, worth 26% of your final grade. In-lecture assignments are worth 2 marks each, and will be graded based on <b>completeness</b> and <b>quality</b> of the answers. Each tutorial will be in the form critique session (i.e. studio), where every group present their weekly progress to the rest of the class while other students take notes for their critique. Critique write-ups are due by 8:00am sharp the day after each studio. Individual critiques are worth 3 marks each and will be graded based on <b>completeness</b>, <b>actionability</b> and <b>positiveness</b> (see below for more details). Note: the in-class activity in Lecture 1 and Tutorial 1 will serve as a training session and will not count toward your grade. Lecture 10 and Tutorial 8 do not have an in-class assignment.

	  <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> Individual participation to group work </h4>
	  Group participation is worth 10% of your final grade. At the end of the term, you will be asked to provide a peer-review of all of the members of your group (including you). On the basis of each member's overall contribution over the entire project, you will allocate a fixed amount of virtual money among the members. The allocation should be based on quality of ideas contributed, work done, time invested in the project, group participation and collaboration, and personal commitment and effort. Your individual grade for group participation will be computed based on your peers' evaluations, and can be up to 10 marks.

	  <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> Group assignments (A0-A4) </h4>
	  Group assignments are worth 34% of your final grade. Every member of the same group will get the same grade for the assignments. The break-down of how each assignment will be graded is detailed in the <a href="assignments.html">assignment handouts</a>.


	  <br />
	  <br />
	  
	  <h4> In-class group presentations (studios) </h4>
	  Each tutorial will be in the form critique session (i.e. studio), where every group present their weekly progress to the rest of the class while other students take notes for their critique. All of the groups have to present at every tutorial to receive feedback from the audience. Group presentations in class are worth 10% of your final grade. Each presentation will be graded based on [...].

	  The final presentation (Tutorial 8) will be graded according to the following criteria:
	  <ul class="regularlist">
	    <li> <b> Topic & Idea Originality (1)</b>: Is this a brand new idea or a significant improvement over existing devices or technologies? Does the project address a new culture or service not currently sufficiently addressed by technology OR applies a significantly novel approach?</li>
	    <li> <b> User Centeredness (1) </b>: Does the design address a real user need? Has the project responded to real user needs as uncovered by the research? Has the project used feedback from their users to improve the design? </li>
	    <li> <b> Design Quality (1) </b>: Is the design well conveyed in prototypes and mockups? Are they using appropriate technologies for the defined problem? Does it match user needs and expectations, and match users' technical capabilities?
	      Presentation </li>
	    <li> <b>Quality (1) </b>: Audience engagement, presenter enthusiasm, delivery clarity, quality of presentation materials & timeliness.</li>
	  </ul>
