	  <br />

	  <h4> ATTENDANCE </h4>

You are expected to attend and actively participate to lectures and tutorials (which will be used as a studio in this course, weeks 4-12). Your overall attendance is worth 10% of your final grade. For each class, you will earn 0 points if you are absent, 0.3 points if you attended at least half of the class but were not present before the start of the class (even if you were late only by a minute), and 0.5 points if you attended the class in full and were present before the start of the class (see the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/classes/csc318-fall2018/rubrics/Rubric-Class Attendance.pdf">class attendance rubric</a>). 
	  
          <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> INDIVIDUAL IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENTS</h4>
	  There will be graded in-class individual assignments every single lecture, worth 24% of your final grade. Each assignment is worth 3 points each, and will be graded based on completeness and quality of the answers. Note: the in-class activity in Lecture 1 will serve as a training session and will not count toward your grade. Lecture 10 will not have an in-class assignment. See the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/classes/csc318-fall2018/rubrics/Rubric-InClassAssignments.pdf"> rubric</a> for the detail of how in-class assignments will be graded.

          <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> INDIVIDUAL IN-STUDIO ENGAGEMENT</h4>
	  You are expected to attend and actively participate in tutorials (which will be used as a studio in this course, weeks 4-12). Your engagement in the studio is worth 10.5% of your final grade. Your engagement grade in each studio class will be calculated based on your active participation to class, e.g. by asking questions, answering questions, making comments after presentations, etc... At each studio, you will earn 0 points for none or poor engagement, 0.4 points for below average participation, 1.0 points for average participation or 1.5 points for good participation (see the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/classes/csc318-fall2018/rubrics/Rubric-In-Studio Engagement.pdf">individual in-studio engagement grading rubric</a>).

          <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> CRITIQUE</h4>
	  Each tutorial will be used as a critique session(i.e. studio), where every group presents their weekly progress to the rest of the class, while other students take notes to create their critique. Critique write-ups are due by 12:00pm (noon) sharp on the day after each studio (i.e. on Fridays, week 4-12). Individual critiques are worth 1.5 points each, and will be graded based on completeness, actionability and positiveness (see below for more details). Note: critique write-ups for Tutorial 1 will serve as a training assignment and will not count toward your grade. Tutorial 8 will not have a critique write-up assignment due. See the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/classes/csc318-fall2018/rubrics/Rubric-Critique.pdf"> critique rubric</a> for the detail of how critique write-ups will be graded.


	  <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION TO GROUP WORK </h4>
	  Your individual contribution to group work is mandatory and is worth 5% of your final grade. A summary report of who did waht for the assignments is requested for each group assignment. Further, at the end of the term, you will be asked to provide a peer-review of all of the members of your group (including you). The peer-review will assess the quality of ideas contributed, work done, time invested in the project, group participation and collaboration, and personal commitment and effort of every project team member. Your individual grade for contribution to group work will be calculated based on activity reports included in the reports as well as your peers' evaluations, and will be worth up to 5 points.

	  <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> GROUP ASSIGNMENTS (A0-A4) </h4>
	  Group assignments are worth 34% of your final grade. Every member of the same group will get the same grade for the group assignments A0-A4. The break-down of how each assignment will be graded is detailed in the <a href="assignments.html">assignment handouts</a>.


	  <br />
	  <br />

	  <h4> IN-STUDIO GROUP PRESENTATIONS </h4>
	  Each tutorial will be used as a critique session (i.e. studio), where every group presents their weekly progress to the rest of the class while other students take notes to create their critique. All of the groups have to present in every studio to receive feedback from the audience. Group presentations in class are worth 6% of your final grade. Note: the group presentation in Studio 1 (week 4) will serve as a training session and will not count toward your grade. See the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/classes/csc318-fall2018/rubrics/Rubric-InStudio Presentation.pdf"> in-studio group presentations rubric</a> for the detail of how presentations will be graded.



	  
<!--	  
	  <h4> Rubrics for Final presentation</h4>
	  The final presentation (Tutorial 8) will be graded according to the following criteria:
	  <ul class="regularlist">
	    <li> <b> Topic & Idea Originality (1)</b>: Is this a brand new idea or a significant improvement over existing devices or technologies? Does the project address a new culture or service not currently sufficiently addressed by technology OR applies a significantly novel approach?</li>
	    <li> <b> User Centeredness (1) </b>: Does the design address a real user need? Has the project responded to real user needs as uncovered by the research? Has the project used feedback from their users to improve the design? </li>
	    <li> <b> Design Quality (1) </b>: Is the design well conveyed in prototypes and mockups? Are they using appropriate technologies for the defined problem? Does it match user needs and expectations, and match users' technical capabilities?
	      Presentation </li>
	    <li> <b>Quality (1) </b>: Audience engagement, presenter enthusiasm, delivery clarity, quality of presentation materials & timeliness.</li>
	  </ul>
