	  <h4> Class participation grade</h4>
	  
	  Class participation is worth 56% of your final grade. It comprises of an individual grade for class attendence (10% of your final grade), and group and individual grades for in-class activities (56% of your final grade).
	  
	  <br />

	  <ul class="regularlist">
	    <li> <b>Attendance to lectures and tutorials:</b> attendance will be taken for each class, at an arbitrary time during the class: you will earn 0.5 mark for each class you attend, except Lecture 1. Further, you will earn 1.5 marks if you attend the final competition, held on Monday December, 4th. </li> 
	    <li> <b>In-class activities:</b> there will be graded in-class activities at every single lecture and tutorial. In-lecture activities are individual and are worth 2 marks each. In each tutorial (i.e. studio), every group will present their weekly progress to the rest of the class. Presentations in tutorial are worth 2 marks for all of the members of the presenting group. During the presentations, the students who are not members of the presenting group will take notes and critique every other group's work. All students will hand in an individual critique write-up at the end of each tutorial, worth 2 marks per tutorial. Exceptions: the in-class activity in Lecture 1 and Tutorial 1 will serve as a training session, and will not count toward your grade. Lecture 10 does not have an in-class activity. Tutorial 8 is the tutorial competition, presentations will be graded as part of Assignment 4, and there will not be critiques. </li>
	  </ul>

	  Below is a summary of the marks you can earn through class participation:

	  <h4> Assignments grade</h4>
	  Assignments are worth 34% of your final grade. All assignments are group assignments, meaning that every member of the same group will get the same grade for the assignments. The break-down of how each assignment will be graded is detailed in the <a href="assignments.html">assignment handouts</a>.

	  <p/>


	  <h4> Group participation</h4>
	  Group participation is worth 10% of your final grade. It may happen that all of the members of a group do not contribute equally toward the group assignments. At the end of the term, you will be asked to provide a peer-review of all of the members of your group (including you). On the basis of each member's overall contribution over the entire project, you will allocate a fixed amount of virtual money among the members. The allocation should be based on quality of ideas contributed, work done, time invested in the project, group participation and collaboration, and personal commitment and effort. Your individual grade for group participation will be computed based on your peers' evaluations, and can be up to 10 marks.

	  <p/>
	  
	  
	  <h4> Rubrics for Final presentation</h4>
	  The final presentation (Tutorial 8) will be graded according to the following criteria:
	  <ul class="regularlist">
	    <li> <b> Topic & Idea Originality (1)</b>: Is this a brand new idea or a significant improvement over existing devices or technologies? Does the project address a new culture or service not currently sufficiently addressed by technology OR applies a significantly novel approach?</li>
	    <li> <b> User Centeredness (1) </b>: Does the design address a real user need? Has the project responded to real user needs as uncovered by the research? Has the project used feedback from their users to improve the design? </li>
	    <li> <b> Design Quality (1) </b>: Is the design well conveyed in prototypes and mockups? Are they using appropriate technologies for the defined problem? Does it match user needs and expectations, and match users' technical capabilities?
	      Presentation </li>
	    <li> <b>Quality (1) </b>: Audience engagement, presenter enthusiasm, delivery clarity, quality of presentation materials & timeliness.</li>
	  </ul>
