		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	      </header>


	      <b>Q: Should I attend the lectures?</b>
	      <p>R: Yes! You will not get much from the lecture slides alone. The course is aimed to be highly interactive, with hands-in activities planned for each lecture where you will be directly practicing the material learned. Further, class participation counts toward your final grade (see <a href="grading.html">Grading scheme</a>), so missing lectures will result in you losing both attendance and in-class activities marks.</p>

	      <b>Q: Should I attend the tutorials?</b>
	      <p>R: Yes! Tutorials are designed for your group to share their progress to the class, and receive feedback. You will learn a lot from the critique sessions, that will help you identify mistakes and areas for improvements in your work, help you gain insight on the course material through a better understanding of the strenghts and weaknesses of your and others' work, which will ultimately guide future steps of your project. Further, class participation counts toward your final grade (see <a href="grading.html">Grading Scheme</a>), so missing tutorials will result in you loosing both attendance and in-class activities marks. </p>

	      <b>Q: How is my participation grade calculated?</b>

	      <b>Q: I missed a class and did not provide a valid justification. Can I still make up for in-class activities?</b>
