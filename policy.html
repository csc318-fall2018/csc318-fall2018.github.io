	      <h3>Late policy </h3>
	      All assignments are to be submitted on the due date. On-time submissions are graded as normal. Late submissions incur a penalty:
		<ul class="regularlist">
		  <li> &lt;24h late incur a 10% penalty,</li>
		  <li> &lt;48h late incur a 30% penalty,</li>
		  <li> submissions more than 48h late <b>are not accepted</b> and earn a mark of 0.</li>
		</ul>
		<p />
		 


	      <h3>Re-marking </h3>
	      <p>Students requesting re-marking of an assignment must submit detailed reasons in writing to the instructors within 2 weeks after receiving the grade. The request must include the written reasons as to why the students believe the work was incorrectly marked. Re-evaluation appeals are at the discretion of the instructors. Note: adjustments in marks will be rare and could equally result in a lowering or raising of the mark. If a re-revaluation is completed by the instructors, the student must accept the resulting mark as the new mark, whether it goes up or down or remains the same. When appealing a re-evaluation decision, the student accepts this condition.</p>

	      <h3> Contact Policy </h3>
	      <p>When emailing the instructor, begin your subject line with "[CSC318]", followed by a meaningful phrase. Include your full name, section, and markus login in the body of the email. Allow up to 72 hours for a reply. Violation to this policy may incur severe response delays. Contact us using official University of Toronto emails only.</p>
		
	      <h3> Leniency Policy </h3>
	      <p>We will drop your two lowest individual class grades, and pro-rate the remaining marks, regardless of the reasons. For lectures, one class grade includes the marks for attendance and the in-class activity assignment for that day. For studios, one class grade includes the marks for attendance, in-studio engagement, and the critique write-up assignment. This policy takes into account illness and/or personal reasons that may affect your ability to attend class on any given date.</p>
		
	      <h3>Resources </h3>
	      <p> Lectures slides and assignments will be posted on this webpage. It is your responsibility to check this page regularly for updates. Announcements will be posted on Quercus & sent as emails through Quercus. It is your responsibility to check Quercus & your email regularly for incidental communication and updates. </p>

	      <h3>Academic Offenses </h3>
	      <p> All the work you submit must be done by you (individually or within your group), and your work must not be submitted by anyone else. Plagarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. Read the <a href="http://www.artsandandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/rules.htm">Rules and Regulations from the UofT Calendar</a> (especially the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters). You should also review <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fpitt/documents/plagiarism.html">this document regarding plagiarism </a> in the context of CS. <p>

		<h3> Accommodations and Special Considerations </h3>
		<p> Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability or a health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach us and/or <a href="http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as"> the Accessibility Services Office</a> as soon as possible. The Accessibility Services staff are available by appointment to assess needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them know your needs, the quicker they can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course. </p>

		<p> If you have missed class time and/or encounter difficulties completing your course work due to personal circumstances other than illness, you are encouraged to contact <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/advising/ofr"> the Office of the Faculty Registrar </a> for counselling on what special consideration may apply. </p>
