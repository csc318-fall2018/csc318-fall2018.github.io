	      <h3>Late policy </h3>
	      All assignments are to be submitted on the due date. On-time submissions are graded as normal. Late submissions incur a penalty:
		<ul class="regularlist">
		  <li> &lt;24h late incur a 10% penalty,</li>
		  <li> &lt;48h late incur a 30% penalty,</li>
		  <li> submissions more than 48h late <b>are not accepted</b> and earn a mark of 0.</li>
		</ul>
		<p />
		 


	      <h3>Re-marking </h3>
	      <p>Students requesting re-marking of an assignment must submit detailed reasons in writing to the instructors within 2 weeks after receiving the grade. The request must include the written reasons as to why the students believe the work was incorrectly marked. Re-evaluation appeals are at the discretion of the instructors. Note: adjustments in marks will be rare and could equally result in a lowering or raising of the mark. If a re-revaluation is completed by the instructors, the student must accept the resulting mark as the new mark, whether it goes up or down or remains the same. When appealing a re-evaluation decision, the student accepts this condition.</p>

	      <h3> Contact Policy </h3>
	      <p>When emailing the instructor, begin your subject line with "[CSC318]", followed by a meaningful phrase. Include your full name in the body of the email. Allow up to 72 hours for a reply. Violation to this policy may incur severe response delays.</p>
		
		
	      <h3>Resources </h3>
	      <p> Lectures slides and assignments will be posted on this webpage. It is your responsibility to check this page regularly for updates. Announcements will be emailed to you directly. It is your responsibility to check your emails regularly for incidental communication and updates. </p>

	      <h3>Academic Offenses </h3>
	      <p> All the work you submit must be done by you (individually or within your group), and your work must not be submitted by anyone else. Plagarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. Read the <a href="http://www.artsandandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/rules.htm">Rules and Regulations from the UofT Calendar</a> (especially the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters). You should also review <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fpitt/documents/plagiarism.html">this document regarding plagiarism </a> in the context of CS. <p>

		<h3> Accommodations and Special Considerations </h3>
		<p> Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability or a health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach us and/or <a href="http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as"> the Accessibility Services Office</a> as soon as possible. The Accessibility Services staff are available by appointment to assess needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them know your needs, the quicker they can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course. </p>

		<p> If you have missed class time and/or encounter difficulties completing your course work due to personal circumstances other than illness, you are encouraged to contact <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/advising/ofr"> the Office of the Faculty Registrar </a> for counselling on what special consideration may apply. </p>
